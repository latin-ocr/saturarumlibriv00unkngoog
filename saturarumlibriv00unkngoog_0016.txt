“ In honor ot Ocres D. Iunius Iuvenalis, tribune of the
first cohort of Dalmatiam, duumvir quinquennalis, prieat ot
the deified Vespasian, vowed and dedicated (this offering)
at his own expense.” In lavor of thia identification it may
be observed that the satirist closely associatae himself with
Aquinum¹ and mentione Geras in the same connection. 11
we may assume, moreover, that Juvenal, lilre mostmen ot hia
time, saw service in the army in hia youth, the many reter-
ences tc military lite in the satires thus find a ready expla-
nation. But in the absence ot the praenomen it must be
acknowledged that we are on uncertain ground3 for the
municipal official ot the inscription might ae well be the
lether, brother, or some other relative of the poet

8. Martial. A third source of information is Martial,
the only writer ot the first three centuries who mentione the
name ot J uvenal.' That the two poeta were on terma ot
friendship, and even ol intimacy, seems asale inference from
the three epigrams that come in question· In the seventh
book, published in the year 92, Juvenal is called sacua·
due,⁴ which without doubt refers only to his ability as an
orator3 tor all signs point to his having published none ot the
satires until a much later date· About the year 100, atter
Martial had finally retired from Rome to his native place in
Spain, he writes to J uvenal as follows:
