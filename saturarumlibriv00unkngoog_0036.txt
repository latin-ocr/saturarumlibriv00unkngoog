34.“8ο1ιοιία Pithoeana. The oldest commentary cn
Juvenal of which we have any knowledge seems to have been
written in the latter part oi the fourth century.¹ This vas

probably the commentary quoted by G. Valla, in his edition y
ol Juvenal published atVeniee in 1486, though the Ma. used

by him is uo longer extant. In this Me, which ended abruptly

at sat. 8, 198, the author oi the commentary was called l

Probus,¹ and is nov usually referred to as the Probus of Valla,
inasmuch as he is known only by the copious quotations in
Valla's edition. A comparison oi these extracts with the

Ἴ scholia preserved in P and also, without the text, in a ΜΒ. oi

St. Gall (n. 870) shovrs that both comeiromthesame good old
source, though less valuable additions have been made in the
latter. These annotatione, nov known as the Scholia Pitlsoc·
aaa, have transmitted much useiul information, especially

in regard to persons and places mentioued in Juvenal, aud ¹

they are olthe highest importante for the constitutiones the
text, preserving, as they sometimes do, readings vhieh ante·

date all nithe extant Mae.⁸

35. Scholia or Cornutus. Far more voluminous and for
the most part oi little value are the scholia traditionally
attributed to one Cornutus.⁴ uuis commentary, which is
iound with little variation in the interior Mes· irem the ninth
century osward, nov and then offers a good explanation, but,
on the whole, abounds in absurdities, and in dealing with
Roman life, literature, and antiquities often displays the
grossest ignorante.⁸
