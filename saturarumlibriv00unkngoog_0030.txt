was in the early period an essential ieatnre ol the satura and
was accepted ae such by Horace, Juvenal also recognized‚¹
and in this respect he conformed to the practice oi hie prede·
cessure. ln his case, however, the general effect is eo modi·
fied by the constant presence cf the spirit ot censure, espe-
cially in the earlier books, which alone can be said to coutain
real echites, that we are not sc much impreeeed by the variety
ci subject as hy the uniformity of treatment. The clement of
dialogus, also, which was quite regular in the early stages
and was largely introduced by Horace, takes a less prominent
place in Juvenal. The ninth satire is the only real dialogue‚

the third is along monologue with the necessary introduc· ,
tion and conclusion, and fragments cf dialogus are found in 3

the first.¹ Thus we sae that while dealing independently

with the sutura aud developing it to some extent along lines ’

peculiar to himself, he was yet not entirely unmindiul of the
example of his predecessore in this field.

26. Reminlecences of other poete. Like most other '

poete oi his time, Juvenal was doubtlees a diligent student
of literature, both Greek and Roman. His use ot Homeric
names and eomparieons ¹ and his occasional reminisccncee of
Lucilius, Ovid, Petronius, Seneca,⁴ and other writers, which
are pointed out from time to time in the commentary,
furnish good ground ior this statement. But there are
authore whose greater influence on the satirist calls tor
special remark3 namely, vergii· Horace,⁸ and Martial.²
When we remember that hythe latter part oi the first cen·

tury Vergil and Horace were the text-books of every Roman
schoolboy,⁸ we are nct surprised tc find echoes oi these
poete everywhere in the literature ol the period. In the
