The sphere again is Lucretius and satire. Lucretius,probably
after Ennius, neglecta the rule ot a proper name. On the
other haud, most ol his examples occur in passages which
are not epic, but dogmatic. Here also Juvenal imitatas the
freedom ot Lucretius. Only 6 ci his 25 cases are proper
names.

One line ending in a word oi six syllables (7, 218) is found
in Juvenal (but see the note). Manilius quotes three
others from Lucretius aud iour or flve more only from the
later poeta.

154. To begin a new sentence or clause at the arth loot,

was usually avoided by the best poeta. It occurs in Juvenal ¹
with some trequeney, generally tor effect, ss in 1, 149, etc.
155. Elialon ¹ is the law ot the Iatiu lauguage. If it vas

desirable tc avoid it, the sentence had to be so arranged as ¹
to prevent concurrence ot vowels. Frequeney ot elision and Ἴ

treedcm in its use was characteristic ot the spoken language,
and ot eomedy and satire, the two literary departments most
nearly allied to it. Ennius allowed harsh elision, but the
influence ot Homer, eud possibly ot the Saturnian, made
his uso ot elision very limited. Lucilius had a great many,
but rar less than comedy. Lucretius lollowed Lucilius,
Catullus lollowed Ennius. Vergil avoided harsh elisions,
but otherwise is noteble tor his ireedom. Ovid largely re·
duced elision, and the process ot diminution finally reached
the vanishing point in some ot the later Latin poeta.

Juvenal shows a lreedom which may be generally defined
as due to his department, less, thau that ot earlier satire, far
greater, than that ot contemporary epic or epigram. Other·
