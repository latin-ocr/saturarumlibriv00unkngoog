d. Bucolic diaeresis, especially with a spondeo in the
iourth ioot, is common to the point 01 monotony in Catullus
aud Lucretius. Avoidance 0111 is noticeable in Vergil end
it was used less and less by themora careiul among later
poete, owing to the iact that it made conflict in the fourth
’ 1001 cll but impossible. Compare:

VIII. Mattiaci Aeoliisachnum Ι rupibus autrum
Juvenal in r, t and 1 shows the only way iu which this ¹

diaeresis could be combined with conflict in the fourth 1001. l

best apprecieted byreadingalong passage aloud. It will be ’

seen that the variety¹ and haedum 01 satire have been adopted ἵ

even here the effect 01 chronolcgy is visible. J uvenal's 44 st ἐ

01 dactyle in the first iour feet is slightly larger than that 01 3
Vorgil. Persius end Lucan belong in ibe same class. l
