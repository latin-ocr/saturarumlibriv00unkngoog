oi the satirist. Mueh more may this be said of Rome, with
its great wealth‚ its large proletariat which had to be fedanti
amused at public eost, and its hordeaci slaves who were
sapping the very foundations of the empire by corrupting
the home, the iountain of national strength. Nevertheless it
seems likely that Juvenal, at least in those satiras which are
not purely general, had before his eye for the most part only

the past, sometimes the distant past known to him only
from history, but as arule the reign ol Domitian, during
which his own early manhood was passed. His peculiar con-
fusion of past and present might be illustrated by many
examples. In Saliae 13, 157, which was published later than
127), he mentions Rutilius Gallicus, the praefectae arbi, aa

Gallicus died iu 91 or 92, having been praefectae arbi some
four or five years earlier.¹ Crispinus, the favorite ol Domi·

them long since dead, move before us as contemporaries of
the poet ; and, to go further back, Sophonius Tigellinus·
the wauton and oruel lavorite of Nero, is chosen as a type of
the influential man whom it would be dangerous to attack.

nal would produce an entirely false and one-sided impression
oi the Rome of the first century if wo should fail to observe
that almost without exception his satire is directed against
the wealthy, the poweriul, and the higher classes of society.
Especially in the first three books are they assailed under
various names,' and accused oi every conceivable torm of
crime.⁸ 'l'be women of noble birth come in ior their
share of condemnatiou in the sirth satire, in which there
pasees before our eyes a series of vivid pictores hardly to be
paralleled in literature for lurid coloring and disgusting
