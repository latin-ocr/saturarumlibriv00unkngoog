iu literature ¹Juvenal mentions Lucan,⁸ Quintilian,¹ and
Statius) but has no reference either ιο his friend Martiil
or to the other famous writers of the period. But, apart
from such names as represent well-known persons, there are
many names, appearing in Juvenal alone or in both Juvenal
and Martial, which are unknown from other sources.‘ For
example, Matho in r, 32 is a lawyer, in γ, 129 a bankrupt,
in 11, 34 a mouthing orator; in these, however, as in mauy
other similar cases, there is nothing to show that the same
individnal is meant. On the whole, it seems likely that
those names which cannot be connected with persons known
to history are, at least in many* instances, purely fictitious
and were taken at randum ιο represent certain more or less
clearly defined types.‘

entirely his own. He did not allow himself the variety
of metros employed by Ennius, Lucilius, Varro, and Petro·
nius3 bnt, following the example of Horace, confined him-
' self to the dactylic hexameter. And yet the hexameter oi
Juvenal is a very different verse irem that of Lucilius or
even of Horace. Instead of the rather rough and careless

metre of the earlier satiriets, with its frequent elisione
and metrioal licenses, we find in Juvenal the more polished,
stately, end sonorous rhythm which was characteristic
of the cpio poetry ol his time and which was based on
imitation of Vergil. The medley of subjecte treated, which
