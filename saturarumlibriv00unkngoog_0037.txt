The style ot Juvenal

36. The work oi lew poete presente at the sams tima euch
high excellence and eueh glaring imperiection as that or
Juvenal. Hie extraordinary giit ior theliielike presentation
ot details was reinioroed and displayed to the best advantage
by a style whose rhetorical brillianea was due partly to hie
own nature and training and partly to the tendenoies oi his
time. No one who has read the first satire, ior example, ean
ever iorget the picture oi Crispinus with his Tyrion oloak and
massiva ring, oi the young eport showing oli hie laet horsea
to hie eweatheart on the Flaminiae Way, or oi the distribu-
tion οἱ the dole in the early morning to a motley orowd.¹
But this commend oi details and maetery ot brilliant phrase
ieeounterbalaueed by an almost complete laek ot the sense ol
proportion and au utter disregard ior harmonious etrneture.¹
