In the last two leet, as will be seen, Juvenal avoids elision.
This began with Catullus and was finally settled by Vergil.¹
He also agrees with all poete after tbe satires of Horace in
avoiding any elision in the first thesis.¹ On the other hand,
except in the last two feet, Juvenal shows the freedom of
satire in taking no special pains to avoid the elision of a long
vowel. Alao his frequent elision (83 cases) after the ed the·
sis is always harah because it tende to obscure the caesura.

Only about 100 verses, according to Eskuche, contain as
many aa two elisione. Loss tban a acore have three elisione
(cf. 2, 343 10, 1973 13, 89, 1083 14,12'l; 16, 35). Oneonly ·
(11, 161) contains five.

156. fflatus' is the occasional exception to the universal
rule of elision. 'Phe sphere of it in hexameter is largely

Ennius, Lucilius, and Vergil. It occurs most readily witha

long vowel and before the caesura or some other decided
pause. Juvenal follows the rules. His cases are 12, 36 3 3,
7036,274, 468310,281;12‚ 110314,4a;15,12631, 1513
2, 26 ; 5, 158 ; 8, 241 (but see note).1

151. Prosody. synaeresis shows nothing unusual and
diaeresis does aot occur. 'Phe one unusual case of syncope is
striglibus (3. 263). Systole occurs only in the usual alterius
(6, 431; 10,210; 11, 1693 15, 39) and once, illius (6, ota).

Final 1 in abi aud 111 11 always short, in otique aud ibidem,
always long ; in mihi, tibi, aidi, long in the thesis, short in
thc arsis.

Final o, not dative aad ablativa, is short in the arsis, long
in the thesis. But only verbal and adverbia] o is found long
