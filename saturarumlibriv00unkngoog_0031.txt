satires ol Juvenal are lound reminiscentes oi word end
phrase, often with the thought or point oi view quite
changed, -borrowed comparisona parodies, metrioal and
other peculiarities, all oi whieh point to the satirist's
thorongh familiarity with these writers and sometimes even
eonsoious imitation ot them.¹ But there is none with
whom Juvenal seems to have had so close a literary eon·
neotion as with Martial. When the two authors are read
together, as the)⁷ should be, coincidenoes ot thought and
expression orowd upon the attention in suoh numbers that it
is impossible to escape the oonolusion that the oue was deeply
influenoed by the other. We have seen that the two poete
were on terma ot intimate friendship,¹ so that Juvenal must
have been perieotly familiar with the epigrama, the last oi
whioh were published in the year 101-102, sometime, in all
probability, before he had written any oi the subires? We
are not to suppose, theu, that the numerous striking parallels
are on the whole merely aoeidentnl and caused by a common
environm'ent,‘ or that the two poete “virtually worked
together ” ¹3 hut rather we are led to eouolude that Juvenal,
sometimes unoonsoiously, but otton intentionally, allowed
the familiar thoughts and even the words oi his friend to
reappear in his own pagos. As a rule, however, he seems to
have avoided expressing the same thought in the same way
as Martial, though now and then he borrows Martial's words,
giving them s new meaning or adapting them to a different
point ot view·
