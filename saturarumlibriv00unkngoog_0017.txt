Dum tu forsitan inquietus erras
Clamosa, Iuvenalis, in Subura,
Aut collem dominae teris Diuum
Duru per limina te potentiorum
Sudatrix toga ventilat regumque
Maior Caelius ot minor fatigant:
Me multos repetita post Decembres
Accepit moa rusticumque iecit
Auro Bilbilis et superba ierro.¹

Here there is no hint that Juvenal has devoted himself to
literary pursuits, nothing but the contraet between the quiet
restiulness oi the Spanish town and the wearisome dutiae oi
the client in the capital.

9. The satlrcs as a biographical source. When weloolr
into the satires ior information with regard to the iiie oi
their author, we should uae discretion310r a poet is not
necessarily his own biographer. Many a picture which ho
presente may be purely literary, due to the intluencs oi
department or oi other writers, and may have no existence
in fact Even what seems to have adirect personui reference
should not in all cases be regarded as authoritative. We may
reasonably expect, however, to draw irorn the satires some
inferences with regard to the poet's education and char·
aeter· and to fix approximatoly the period oi his literary
activity.

10. Dates oi’ publication. Juvenal, like many other an-

i cient writers, published his satires in books at different times,
} and apparently in the order in which they now stand in the

Mss. In the first book (Sat. 1-5) the latest indication oi time
is the reference to the condemnation oi Marius Priscus, which
took place in the year 100.ι Hence these satires as a whole

must have been published aiter that date, in all probability
’ several years after, unless we are to separate the publication oi

1 the first book irom that oi the second by an unnaturally long
