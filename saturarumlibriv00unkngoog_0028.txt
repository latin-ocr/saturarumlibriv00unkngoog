detail. But we should not suppose that in Rome every man
was a Nero and every woman a Julia; tor Juvenal doubtless'
chose the most striking examples to illustrate and enlorce
his argument. History does not often ooonpy herucli with
simple virtue, but she has fortunately given ns reireshiug
glimpses oi sterling manhood, pure and nohle womanhood,
and domestic peace,¹ which serve to show that private life χ
in the first century was not in all quartem so degenerate as q
Juvenal alone might lead us to suppose.

23. Laok of moral perspectlve. What strikes us ae
most peculiar in J uvenal's attitude toward moral questione is
his lack ol perspective; his fiercest indignation is aroused
by the slightest mults? The youth who squanders his
resourees ou last horsea is just as bad as the husband who
iettens on the proceeds oi his wife's dishonor-perhapa worse,
because he actually holds the reins himself⁸ ; and the most
unspeakable and unuatural vices are far less monstrous than
the public appearance oi a nobleman as a gladiator.⁴
Nothing is more evident than that Juvenal lacked a fine
discrimination in moral questions aud made little affort to
distinguish varying degrees ol guilt.

24. Useorpersouar names. The large number ol per-
soual names in the satires makes it necessary to raise the
question whether or not Juvenal always refers to real per·
sone. Oi course, many well-known historical characters
ligure in these peges: Seianus· the poweriul praefectos
praetorio oi Tiberius ; Pallas· Posides‚' and Narcissus,⁸
the freedmen ol Claudium Lucusta· the poisoner, Tigel-
linus ¹⁰ the boon companion oi Nero, Crispinus ¹¹ the court
invorite, Rutilius Gallicus ¹' the praefectus orbi, and other
prominent figures oi thereign oi Domitian. Ol men eminent
