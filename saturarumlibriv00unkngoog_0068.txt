α. Oceearascmiqcincra'c. This caesura (also knovnaethe
‘penthemimeral' and ‘masculine' caesura) occurs, as its
name indicates (lit. ‘ ξ’), between the thesis and arsis ot the ἶ
third ioot, thus:

1. Qualibet. illa tuo Ι mutantia semper in ore.

The Latin hexameter uses thie caesura more frequently than
all the others put together. The main advantages of it are, ¹
(1) that it is strong and distinct ; (2) that it allovvs the use ol
either a dactyl or a spondae in the third ioot3 (3) that it al·
ways produces conflict in the third foot 3 (4) that, vith this
caesura, conflict in the second, and especially in the fourth
ioot is more easily obtained. In the example quoted (1),
conflict occurs only in the third soot aud ie produced by the
caesura. 'Phe comparative trequency ot such verses in the
satirae oi Horace and Juvenal is a mark of the freedom ci
the department. .

Conflict in the second and fourth feet is produced by malr- ἵ
ing the end oi any vord but a monosyllable coincide with the
thesis in each case, thus:

11. consilium Ι dedimus! Sullae 1 privatus ut altum.

Iu the large majority oi cases, therefore, the regular ‘ pen·
themimeral' caesura is accompanied by one or both of these ’
secondary caesurae. They are named, from their positione in ,
the verse, the ‘trithemimeral' (ecmitcrracria, Ψ) and the 3
‘hephthemimeral’ (semiseptenaria, Ψ). ,

Juvenal himself belongs to a group oi poete who make ³
a larger use of the penthemimeral caesura. The others are
Ovid, Persius, and Claudiam.¹ ι

b. anacrc semiseptenaria. Next to the ‘penthemimeraL’
but at along interval, the-caesura most used by the Roman l
poets is the ‘hephthemimeral.' This should always be ac· γ
